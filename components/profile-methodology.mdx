[Gun Rights](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=Q13&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U&cycle=All) and [Gun Control](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=Q12&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U&cycle=All) data from the [Center for Responsive Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org/about/).

The “total” numbers are the total money given to the member’s campaign or leadership PAC from gun rights or gun control PACs or individuals in all of CRP’s data (back to 1989 for members for whom that is relevant).

The “support/oppose” numbers are money spent by outside groups supporting and opposing these candidates. “Gun rights support,” for example, shows money spent by gun rights groups on independent expenditures supporting this candidate.
